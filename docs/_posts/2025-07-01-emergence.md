title: "Emergence: Why Complexity Sticks Around"

Michael L. Wong and collaborators proposed the idea that *persistence* ‚Äî not purpose ‚Äî drives the emergence of complexity in nature.

Their thesis is simple: systems evolve not because they‚Äôre designed to, but because certain configurations just‚Ä¶ last. Over time, these configurations shape everything from stars and minerals to cells, civilizations, and minds.

They break persistence down into three forces:

1. **Static persistence** ‚Äî structural stability over time.
2. **Dynamic persistence** ‚Äî the ability to vary and adapt.
3. **Novelty generation** ‚Äî discovering functions that help the system stick around longer.

From this, Wong suggests a ‚ÄúLaw of Increasing Functional Information‚Äù:
> **Natural systems explore ever more complex configurations ‚Äî because complexity, when useful, tends to persist.**

But how exactly does nature find these persistent patterns?

## üîç Brute-Force Search Through the Universe

The universe isn‚Äôt trying to build stars or invent life. It just tries everything ‚Äî and some things happen to work.

Think of nature as exploring a vast *possibility space* of configurations. Most combinations of matter and energy are unstable and disappear instantly. But a few ‚Äî atoms, replicating molecules, neurons ‚Äî stick around. And once they do, they unlock new ways for systems to persist.

Each persistent configuration becomes a platform for reaching even more persistent ones.

This process is unguided, but far from random. It‚Äôs like a brute-force search that filters out instability at every step. What‚Äôs left is what works.

## üßó The Climbing Landscape of Complexity

Imagine a rugged landscape where each point is a possible configuration of a system, and the elevation represents its persistence.

- Small steps (mutations, variations) can move a system to nearby configurations.
- If a step leads uphill ‚Äî to a more persistent state ‚Äî it may get selected.
- Steep jumps (rare coincidences) can happen but are improbable.
- Some paths are blocked entirely, depending on where the system starts.

This metaphor helps us understand why some complex systems emerge and others don‚Äôt. Also, while some steep jumps are not possible as the probability is too low, there may be other ways to get there. For example, it is unlikely, but not strictly impossible, that a fully functional single-cell organism appears on planet earth just by molecules aligning in the right setup by chance. However, with smaller steps such as replicating pre-cursors of cells and many more steps, it is possible for such a rather complex system to arise. The trick is that each step on that path must be persistent, that is, it has some property that keeps it around long enough and with enough density to be the foundation for the next step. And it does not have to be a complex system, it can be just a steady state of a dynamic system where molecules are created and destroyed continuously, but over time there is a certain amount of those molecules around such that they can be part of the next step of exploration.

Evolutionary adaptation is just one version of this hill-climbing. Any dynamic system ‚Äî not just biology ‚Äî can do this, if it can move and persist.

One interesting fact is that in this process, time and population size are interchangeable: a large number of entities evolving over a short time is equivalent to a small number evolving over a long time. What matters is the total number of operations ‚Äî the product of time and population size.

## ‚ú® What Is Emergence?

Emergence happens when this hill-climbing leads to a *qualitatively new* level ‚Äî like life, intelligence, or consciousness.

This doesn‚Äôt mean something magical happens. As Sean Carroll and others point out, emergent properties can in principle be understood from lower-level dynamics ‚Äî but often only with massive computational effort.

More importantly: emergent properties are useful. They *help the system persist* in a changing environment.

Take intelligence: it's hard to derive from neuron firings, but easy to explain at the level of behavior. And it helps animals survive and reproduce. That's persistence in action. And this utility at the higher level is what seems magic and hard to explain. Why does that happen?

## üéØ Why Emergent Systems Are Abstractable

Here‚Äôs the curious thing: emergent systems tend to *detach* from their physical substrate.

They‚Äôre better understood at the level of **function** than at the level of **implementation**.

Take a simple digital counter:

- At the hardware level, it‚Äôs just voltages and transistors.
- But functionally, it counts from 0 to 7 ‚Äî and loops.
- That meaning only exists in the *abstract layer*.

The low-level behavior implements the abstraction, but it‚Äôs the *function* ‚Äî the utility ‚Äî that makes the system matter.

Now you could say that the counter is just a human construction and the higher level meaning was basically there first. The lower level, the implementation of the counter, was created later, based on that maening. While this is true, nature could also create that counter, either randomly aligning elements that count (rather unlikely) or in a step-wise manner, starting from binary switches that are able to persist. The trick is persistence: if the binary switches are not able to stay around long enough for some reason, e.g., because they are made of molecules in a steady state, then more complex counters can't form. The same is true for the more complex counters, which must have a reason to stay. And this reason can come from the higher emergent level, the meaning of counting numbers. For example, if the counter is integrated into a more complex system and counting helps that system to survive, then this utility creates persistence for that counter.

This gives two reasons for persistence:

- direct: the system has some inner persistence, e.g., a steady state, a replicating cell, etc.
- indirect: the system helps a larger system to persist.

Both can lead to emergence. Examples:

### Life

A living cell is a complex system and you can describe it at a higher level. Replication is a key feature at the higher level and the reason for life to persist. But replication is also a very simple concept of taking a stable system and creating a copy of it. This concept has such a high value for persistence that once discovered by nature it won't easily disappear. It spreads all over the place and modifies itself. Even if some forms of life disappear there are many other that will further spread.

But how is it possible that we can summarize this at the higher level in such simple terms? Why does a simple concept exist? We know that it emerges because it was there is in the first place: laws of physics allow it to exist and nature is able to find this state to discover this concept. It is like a blueprint according to which nature acts.

To understand why the blueprint seems to be there before the actual system is constructed, we have to look at all possible systems that can exist. The laws of physics allow an infinite amount of interactions in dynamic systems. The vast amount of these interactions are rather boring. For example, simple particle interactions in an open system, particles bouncing into each other but never meeting again. Other interactions are more interesting, such as basic chemical reactions that lead to constant construction and desctruction of certain molecules. Here we may have a back-and-forth of interactions.
Finally, there are complex, sometimes circular interactions, such as a ribosome constructing proteins. All those are possible interactions physics allows.

When we zoom out from the base-level details, we do it by intentionally throwing away most of the information‚Äîkeeping only what‚Äôs useful for us. The abstract categories we create, like ‚Äúisland,‚Äù ‚Äúcell,‚Äù or ‚Äúalgorithm,‚Äù aren‚Äôt built into the fabric of the universe. They‚Äôre shortcuts‚Äîlossy summaries that help our limited minds make sense of overwhelming complexity. What counts as a useful abstraction depends on our goals, perspective, and how much detail we can actually handle. Change what you care about or how closely you look, and you‚Äôll end up with different abstractions. So, this ‚Äúmeta level‚Äù isn‚Äôt a deeper reality; it‚Äôs just the compressed view that happens to work for us in the moment. So emergence happens when compression into abstract descriptions that work very well.

For example, think about how we describe the Earth. In reality, it's an ocean of atoms, but for most of our needs, we compress all that into a map with just a few continents and oceans. This works because the land and water naturally cluster into large regions, letting us ignore almost all the microscopic detail. If the world had instead been made of countless tiny islands, we'd invent a different abstraction‚Äîmaybe just ‚Äúocean‚Äù at the most abstract level or ‚Äúocean with scattered land.‚Äù The map isn‚Äôt reality itself, but the best shortcut our minds can use, based on the patterns that happen to exist.

But there are also systems where compression only gets us so far. Take the weather as an example. If you want to know what the atmosphere is doing at every point, there‚Äôs no simple way to compress that complexity‚Äîair currents, temperatures, and pressures interact at every scale, from tiny eddies to massive jet streams. We can still use very lossy descriptions (‚Äúit‚Äôs sunny and windy in Berlin‚Äù), but as soon as we want to predict local turbulence or the exact path of a storm, these abstractions break down. To really capture what‚Äôs happening, we‚Äôre forced back to simulating or measuring the base-level details. In some systems, complexity refuses to be compressed.

Back to the meaning that exists at the higher level. If it is just our invention after the fact, how can it be a driving force for persistence? Well, it actually isn't. The driving force are the interactions at the base level. Still, those interactions have a meaning but its much more complex. This meaning can often be represented in a compressed form which is then the emergent ???. The concept of life is an abstraction we invented for the complex process of replication that involves a huge amount of molecules. It creates persistence because the cells can "replicate". But at the base level, it is huge amounts of molecules that are combining other molecules and the cell is just a very good abstraction. Of course, there is a reason why a cell is formed like a cell which makes it a good candidate for abstraction when zooming out. And its closed form is a reason why it works so well since it keeps all compartments together etc. But there could also be a less closed system that replicates and we would find another abstraction for it. And there could be a different form of spreading that is not replication, e.g., fire spreads without "replication" and without being alife, and we also find other descriptions for those.

To summarize, there is an infinite amount of possible combinations of objects and nature is able to find some of them using the search algorithm. Once such objects have been found, and if there are many of them, we can zoom out and call it emergent.

## üí° Utility = The Engine of Emergence

Let‚Äôs tie it together:

When a system has utility, it:

1. **Survives** longer (physically or computationally).
2. **Gets reused** or replicated (biologically, socially).
3. **Becomes explainable** at a higher level (because it serves a function).

So utility doesn't just help systems stick around ‚Äî it *creates meaning*.

That‚Äôs why we can talk about:

- *Minds*, not just neurons.
- *Organisms*, not just molecules.
- *Counters*, not just bits.

These are not illusions. They‚Äôre emergent layers of function ‚Äî meaningful because they persist and serve a role.

## üß© Final Thought: Meaning Emerges from Persistence

The universe doesn‚Äôt build minds, language, or life on purpose. It just filters configurations that *work*.

When something persists, it becomes *worth talking about* ‚Äî because it creates a new level of utility.

And that‚Äôs where meaning begins.
